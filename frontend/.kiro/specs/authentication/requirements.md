# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication system for the campus application. The authentication system will provide secure user registration, login, logout, and session management capabilities. It will integrate with the existing React/TypeScript application and support role-based access control for different user types (students, faculty, staff, administrators).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account, so that I can access personalized campus features and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, confirm password, and user type fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and send a verification email
3. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the email is already registered
4. WHEN a user provides a password that doesn't meet security requirements THEN the system SHALL display specific password validation errors
5. IF the password and confirm password fields don't match THEN the system SHALL display an error message
6. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a verification pending page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account, so that I can access my personalized dashboard and campus features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to their dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message without revealing which field is incorrect
4. WHEN a user's account is not verified THEN the system SHALL display a message prompting email verification
5. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session and store authentication tokens
6. IF a user is already logged in and visits the login page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out of my account, so that my session is properly terminated and my data remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate their session
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and redirect to the login page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear any cached user data from the browser

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Remember me"
2. IF a user selects "Remember me" THEN the system SHALL extend the session duration to 30 days
3. WHEN a user returns to the application with a valid session THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them
4. WHEN a user's session token expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh the token automatically
5. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to different features based on user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL assign them a default role based on their user type selection
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL load their role and permissions
3. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected route THEN the system SHALL verify their permissions
4. IF a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message
5. WHEN an administrator updates user roles THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new permissions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user submits their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a reset link to their email
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL display a new password form
4. WHEN a user submits a new password THEN the system SHALL update their password and invalidate the reset link
5. WHEN a reset link is older than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL consider it expired and display an error
6. WHEN a user successfully resets their password THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my account to be protected with email verification, so that only I can access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send a verification email to their provided email address
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL mark their account as verified
3. WHEN an unverified user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL prevent login and show verification required message
4. WHEN a user requests a new verification email THEN the system SHALL send a fresh verification link
5. WHEN a verification link is older than 24 hours THEN the system SHALL consider it expired

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system user, I want sensitive pages to be protected by authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot access private information or functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in from a redirect THEN the system SHALL redirect them back to their originally requested page
3. WHEN an authenticated user's session expires while on a protected page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login and preserve their intended destination
4. WHEN a user lacks sufficient permissions for a protected page THEN the system SHALL display an access denied page
5. WHEN the system detects an invalid or tampered authentication token THEN the system SHALL immediately log out the user and redirect to login
6. WHEN a user navigates between protected pages THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status on each route change
