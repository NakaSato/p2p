# P2P Energy Trading Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Architecture-First Development
All development follows established system architecture documented in `.specify/docs/architecture/`
- API Gateway as central service hub with Rust/Axum implementation
- PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for data persistence and time-series analytics
- Solana blockchain integration for energy token trading
- Modular design with clear service boundaries and interfaces

### II. Documentation-Driven Development
All technical work references and updates documentation in `.specify/docs/`
- Development plans track progress and guide implementation
- API specifications define contracts before implementation
- Architecture documentation captures design decisions and rationale
- Testing documentation ensures comprehensive validation

### III. Security-First Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Security considerations integrated at every development stage
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- Secure blockchain integration with proper key management
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

### IV. Test-Driven Quality Assurance
Comprehensive testing strategy with multiple validation layers
- Unit tests for all business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end testing with Postman automation suite
- Performance testing for response time and scalability requirements

### V. Production-Ready Operations
All code and infrastructure prepared for production deployment
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Health monitoring and observability (metrics, logging, tracing)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with quality gates
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

## Technical Documentation Structure

All technical development documentation is organized in `.specify/docs/` with the following structure:

### Development Documentation (`.specify/docs/development/`)
- `API_GATEWAY_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Primary development roadmap and progress tracking
- `API_GATEWAY_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete API specifications and contracts
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Overall project development strategy
- `SMART_METER_SIMULATION.md` - Energy meter integration specifications
- `CONTACT_ANALYSIS.md` - System integration analysis
- `plan/` - Implementation timelines and project structure

### Architecture Documentation (`.specify/docs/architecture/`)
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system design and component relationships
- `PoA-Architecture.md` - Blockchain consensus and architecture details
- `TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation technology stack and decisions
- `contracts-diagram.md` - Smart contract architecture and interactions

### Deployment Documentation (`.specify/docs/deployment/`)
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete containerization and deployment guide
- `DOCKER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Development and operations quick reference
- `DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Performance and storage optimization
- `DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and resolution procedures

### Testing Documentation (`.specify/docs/testing/`)
- `AUTHENTICATION_TEST_REPORT.md` - Authentication system validation results
- `postman/` - Complete API testing suite with automation and CI/CD integration

### Blockchain Documentation (`.specify/docs/blockchain/`)
- `BLOCKCHAIN_CONSENSUS.md` - Consensus mechanism and blockchain implementation
- `README-ANCHOR.md` - Anchor framework integration and smart contract development
- `transaction-flow-example.md` - Transaction patterns and flow documentation

## Development Workflow Standards

### Code Development Process
All development work must reference and update relevant documentation:
1. Check current development plan status in `development/API_GATEWAY_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. Review architecture documentation for design compliance
3. Follow testing procedures documented in `testing/` directory
4. Update progress and documentation as work is completed

### Quality Assurance Requirements
Every feature and change must pass comprehensive validation:
1. Unit testing with documented test cases
2. Integration testing following established procedures
3. API testing using Postman automation suite
4. Performance validation against documented benchmarks
5. Security review using established security guidelines

### Deployment and Operations
All deployments follow documented procedures:
1. Use Docker deployment guides for environment setup
2. Follow troubleshooting procedures for issue resolution
3. Implement monitoring and observability as documented
4. Maintain deployment documentation with operational changes

## Governance

### Documentation Authority
The `.specify/docs/` technical documentation serves as the authoritative source for:
- System architecture and design decisions
- Development plans, timelines, and progress tracking
- API specifications and implementation contracts
- Testing procedures and quality assurance standards
- Deployment and operational procedures

### Change Management
All significant technical changes require:
1. Documentation review and updates in relevant `.specify/docs/` sections
2. Impact assessment against established architecture principles
3. Testing validation following documented procedures
4. Approval from technical leads with architecture knowledge

### Compliance Verification
All development work must demonstrate compliance with:
- Documented architecture principles and technical standards
- Security requirements as outlined in development plans
- Testing standards documented in the testing framework
- Performance benchmarks established in technical specifications

### Constitution Updates
This constitution evolves with the project:
- Technical documentation drives constitutional refinements
- Architecture changes require constitutional review
- New development phases may introduce additional principles
- All changes documented with rationale and implementation timeline
