### 4. SPL Energy Token Process

#### **Step 1: Engineering Energy Generation Detection**
1. AMI smart meters (METER_001-015) detect renewable energy generation within Engineering Complex
2. Real-time data transmitted to Engineering Department oracle via secure network
3. Energy data processed and validated for accuracy within Engineering systems
4. Net energy surplus calculated (generation - consumption) for Engineering participants

### 5. Data Flow Architecture

#### **Contact Service Deployment Flow**
```

   ├── Verify RPC endpoint accessibility
   └── Confirm network compatibility
