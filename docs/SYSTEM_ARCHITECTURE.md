### 4. SPL Energy Token Process

#### **Step 1: Engineering Energy Generation Detection**
1. AMI smart meters (ENG_001-015) detect renewable energy generation within Engineering Complex
2. Real-time data transmitted to Engineering Department oracle via secure network
3. Energy data processed and validated for accuracy within Engineering systems
4. Net energy surplus calculated (generation - consumption) for Engineering participants

#### **Step 2: SPL Token Minting Authorization**
1. Oracle Program receives validated meter data from Engineering AMI systems
2. Includes: meter ID (ENG_001-015), energy amount, generation source, timestamp
3. Data verified against registered Engineering student/faculty accounts
4. Oracle triggers SPL token minting for verified energy generation within Engineering Complex

#### **Step 3: Engineering Department Validation**
1. Engineering Department oracle validates AMI data authenticity from Engineering meters
2. Cross-reference with Engineering Complex renewable energy installations
3. Verify meter assignments and Engineering user registrations
4. Validate energy generation data against Engineering system parameters
5. Authorize SPL token minting for verified energy generation by Engineering participants

#### **Step 4: SPL Token Minting and Trading**
