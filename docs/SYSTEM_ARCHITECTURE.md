### 4. REC Validation Process

#### **Step 1: Energy Generation Detection**
1. AMI smart meters detect renewable energy generation
2. Real-time data transmitted to university IT systems
3. Energy data processed and validated for accuracy
4. Net energy surplus calculated (generation - consumption)

#### **Step 2: REC Certificate Request**
1. University blockchain node creates REC validation request
2. Includes: meter ID, energy amount, generation source, timestamp
3. Request signed by university authority
4. Submitted to regulatory authority validators

#### **Step 3: Regulatory Validation**
1. PEA/MEA/EGAT validators receive REC requests
2. Cross-reference with official renewable energy registrations
3. Verify university's renewable energy installation permits
4. Validate AMI data against regulatory standards
5. Issue official REC certificate if approved

#### **Step 4: Token Minting**
1. REC certificate validated by minimum 2 of 3 regulators
2. Energy tokens minted on blockchain
3. Tokens backed by official government REC certificates
4. Available for trading within campus energy market

### 5. Governance Structure

#### **University Authority**
- **Role**: Campus operations and blockchain node management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage AMI infrastructure
  - Coordinate with regulatory authorities
  - Oversee campus energy trading operations
  - Ensure compliance with regulations

#### **Regulatory Authority Consensus**
- **Minimum Validators**: 2 out of 3 (PEA, MEA, EGAT)
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof of Authority (PoA)
- **Validation Requirements**:
  - Official government energy regulator status
  - Legal authority to issue REC certificates
  - Access to national renewable energy registry
  - Compliance with national energy policies

### 6. Technical Implementation

#### **Solana Anchor Programs**
1. **Registry Program**: User and AMI meter registration
2. **Energy Token Program**: SPL tokens with REC validation
3. **Trading Program**: Campus energy marketplace
4. **Oracle Program**: AMI data integration and processing
5. **Governance Program**: Regulatory authority management

#### **AMI Integration**
