# P2P Energy Trading Platform: Smart Contract System Proposal

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and design of the smart contract system for the P2P Energy Trading Platform. The system is built on a modular, multi-contract architecture, ensuring separation of concerns, security, and upgradeability. It consists of four core contracts that work in concert to facilitate a decentralized energy marketplace.

The core components are:
- **Registry Contract**: The single source of truth for identity and asset management.
- **GridToken (GRID) Contract**: A PSP22-compliant fungible token for value exchange.
- **Trading Contract**: The decentralized marketplace for energy trading.
- **Oracle Client Contract**: A secure bridge to off-chain data and automation.

This proposal details the purpose, features, and key functions of each contract.

## 2. Registry Contract (`registry`)

The Registry contract is the foundation of the system, managing the identities of all participants and their associated assets (smart meters).

### 2.1. Purpose

- To register and verify all users (Prosumers and Consumers).
- To manage the assignment of smart meters to users.
- To maintain a list of authorized REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) Regulators who can administer the registry.

### 2.2. Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Only authorized REC Regulators can modify the registry.
- **User and Asset Management**: Provides a canonical record of all participants and their devices.
- **Status Tracking**: Manages the status of users (Active, Suspended, Deactivated).

### 2.3. Core Data Structures

- **`UserInfo`**: Stores details about a user, including their type (`Prosumer`/`Consumer`), location, and status.
- **`UserType`**: Enum representing user capabilities:
  - `Prosumer`: Can both generate and consume energy (recommended for most users)
  - `Consumer`: Can only consume energy (for users without generation capabilities)
- **`UserStatus`**: Enum for the current state of a user account.

**Design Note**: In practice, most users should be registered as `Prosumer` type since they may install solar panels in the future. The `Consumer` type is primarily for users who will never have energy generation capabilities (e.g., renters).

### 2.4. Key Functions (Messages)

- `register_user(user, user_type, location)`: Registers a new user. (Regulator only)
  - **Best Practice**: Register most users as `Prosumer` for flexibility
- `assign_meter(meter_id, owner)`: Links a smart meter to a registered user. (Regulator only)
- `update_user_status(user, new_status)`: Changes a user's status. (Regulator only)
- `update_user_type(user, new_type)`: Allows upgrading Consumer â†’ Prosumer. (Regulator only)
- `add_rec_regulator(new_regulator)`: Adds a new administrator. (Regulator only)
- `is_user_verified(user)`: Publicly checks if a user is registered and active.
- `is_prosumer(user)`: Checks if a user can create sell orders.
- `get_meter_owner(meter_id)`: Returns the owner of a specific meter.

### 2.5. Events

- `UserRegistered`: Emitted when a new user is added.
- `MeterAssigned`: Emitted when a meter is linked to a user.
- `UserStatusUpdated`: Emitted on user status changes.
- `RecRegulatorAdded`: Emitted when a new regulator is authorized.

## 3. GridToken Contract (`grid-token`)

The GridToken (GRID) contract implements the platform's native utility token, used for all economic activities.

### 3.1. Purpose

- To provide a PSP22-compliant fungible token for settling energy trades.
- To represent generated energy, where **1 GRID = 1 kWh**.
- To manage the minting (creation) and burning (destruction) of tokens in a controlled manner.

### 3.2. Key Features

- **PSP22 Standard**: Fully compatible with the Polkadot standard for fungible tokens, ensuring interoperability.
- **Controlled Supply**: Only authorized "Minter" accounts (like the Oracle Client) can create new tokens, and only authorized "Burner" accounts can destroy them.
- **Registry Integration**: Can be configured to check the Registry contract to ensure tokens are only minted for verified users.

### 3.3. Core Data Structures

- The contract primarily uses `ink::storage::Mapping` to store `balances`, `allowances`, `minters`, and `burners`.

### 3.4. Key Functions (Messages)

- `mint(to, amount, meter_id)`: Creates new tokens and assigns them to a user, typically after verifying energy generation data. (Minter only)
- `burn(from, amount)`: Destroys tokens from a user's balance, representing energy consumption. (Burner only)
- `transfer(to, value, data)`: Standard PSP22 function to transfer tokens between users.
- `approve(spender, value)`: Standard PSP22 function to approve a third party (like the Trading contract) to spend tokens on a user's behalf.
- `add_minter(minter)` / `add_burner(burner)`: Authorizes new accounts to mint or burn tokens. (Owner/Admin only)
- `set_registry_contract(registry_contract)`: Links the token to the Registry for user verification.

### 3.5. Events

- `Minted`: Emitted when new tokens are created.
- `Burned`: Emitted when tokens are destroyed.
- `MinterAdded` / `MinterRemoved`: Emitted on changes to the minter list.
- Standard PSP22 events like `Transfer` and `Approval`.

## 4. Trading Contract (`trading`)

The Trading contract is the heart of the marketplace, where users can post buy and sell orders for energy.

### 4.1. Purpose

- To provide a decentralized order book for P2P energy trading.
- To facilitate the matching of buy and sell orders based on price and time priority.
- To settle trades by orchestrating token transfers.

### 4.2. Key Features

- **Periodic Order Book**: Operates in market epochs (e.g., 15 minutes), where orders are collected and then matched in a batch.
- **Automated Clearing**: A `match_orders` function, callable by authorized "Market Makers" (like the Oracle Client), executes the matching algorithm.
- **User-Centric Orders**: Users can create buy and sell orders and cancel their own active orders.

### 4.3. Core Data Structures

- **`Order`**: Contains all details of a buy or sell order, including user, type, amount, price, and status.
- **`Trade`**: Records the details of a successfully executed trade between a buyer and a seller.
- **`OrderType`**: Enum for `Buy` or `Sell`.
- **`OrderStatus`**: Enum for the state of an order (`Active`, `Filled`, `Cancelled`, etc.).

### 4.4. Key Functions (Messages)

- `create_sell_order(energy_amount, price_per_unit)`: Allows a verified prosumer to list energy for sale.
- `create_buy_order(energy_amount, max_price)`: Allows a verified user to place an order to buy energy.
- `cancel_order(order_id)`: Allows a user to cancel their own unfilled order.
- `match_orders()`: Triggers the order matching and trade settlement process. (Market Maker only)
- `add_market_maker(market_maker)`: Authorizes a new account to trigger market clearing. (Owner/Admin only)
- `get_order(order_id)`: Publicly retrieves the details of a specific order.

### 4.5. Events

- `SellOrderCreated` / `BuyOrderCreated`: Emitted when new orders are placed.
- `OrderCancelled`: Emitted when an order is cancelled.
- `TradeExecuted`: Emitted for each successful trade, providing a verifiable record.
- `MarketCleared`: Emitted after the matching process for an epoch is complete.

## 5. Oracle Client Contract (`oracle-client`)

The Oracle Client contract serves as the secure and reliable bridge between the on-chain smart contracts and off-chain systems.

### 5.1. Purpose

- To enable smart contracts to request data from the outside world (e.g., AMI for meter readings).
- To allow external automation services (like Chainlink Keepers) to trigger on-chain functions.
- To manage the lifecycle of data requests and responses from trusted oracle operators.

### 5.2. Key Features

- **Request-Response Model**: Manages data requests and their fulfillment by authorized oracles.
- **Upkeep Automation**: Provides an interface (`check_upkeep`, `perform_upkeep`) compatible with automation networks to trigger periodic tasks like market clearing.
- **Contract Integration**: Acts as a central coordinator, making calls to the `grid-token` contract (to mint) and the `trading` contract (to clear the market).

### 5.3. Core Data Structures

- **`OracleRequest`**: Tracks a data request's ID, requester, type, and status.
- **`RequestType`**: Enum defining the kind of data being requested (e.g., `EnergyData`, `MarketClearing`).
- **`RequestStatus`**: Enum for the state of a request (`Pending`, `Fulfilled`, `Expired`).
- **`MeterData`**: A structured format for receiving energy data from an oracle.

### 5.4. Key Functions (Messages)

- `request_energy_data(meter_id)`: Allows a user to request the latest reading for their meter.
- `fulfill_energy_data(request_id, meter_data)`: Allows an oracle operator to submit data, which triggers token minting. (Oracle Operator only)
- `check_upkeep()`: A view function used by automation networks to see if a task (like market clearing) needs to be performed.
- `perform_upkeep()`: The function called by an automation network to execute a task. (Oracle Operator only)
- `add_oracle_operator(operator)`: Authorizes a new oracle node. (Owner/Admin only)

### 5.5. Events

- `OracleRequestCreated`: Emitted when a new data request is made.
- `EnergyDataFulfilled`: Emitted when an oracle provides data, confirming the action taken (e.g., tokens minted).
- `MarketClearingChecked`: Emitted when the market clearing condition is checked.
- `AutoMarketClearingTriggered`: Emitted when the contract automatically triggers a market clear.
