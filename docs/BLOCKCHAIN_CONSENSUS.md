### 3. Transaction Processing Flow

#### **Energy Trading Transaction Lifecycle**
1. **Transaction Submission**: User submits energy buy/sell order
2. **Validation**: Engineering validator validates transaction format and signatures
3. **Execution**: Anchor programs execute trading logic
4. **Block Inclusion**: Transaction included in next block (400ms slots)
5. **Finalization**: Block immediately finalized (single validator)
6. **Settlement**: Energy tokens transferred, orders matched

#### **Consensus Decision Process**

The Engineering Department validator processes transactions in 400ms slots with immediate finalization. Each slot includes:

1. **Transaction Collection**: Gather pending transactions from mempool
2. **Validation**: Verify signatures, balances, and program instructions  
3. **Execution**: Process transactions through Anchor programs
4. **Block Production**: Create block with validated transactions
5. **Self-Validation**: Immediate consensus as sole validator
6. **Finalization**: Commit block to ledger with sub-second finality
