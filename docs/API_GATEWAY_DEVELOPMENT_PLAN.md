## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Develop a robust, scalable API Gateway that serves as the primary interface between Engineering Department systems and the Solana blockchain infrastructure for P2P energy trading.

The **API Gateway** serves as the central backend service for the P2P Energy Trading Platform, providing a unified interface between the frontend application, database systems, and Solana blockchain infrastructure. Built with Rust and Axum framework for high-performance, type-safe operation.

**Repository**: `/api-gateway/`  
**Technology Stack**: Rust (Edition 2021) + Axum + PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB + Redis  

### Key Objectives
- **Security First**: Implement enterprise-grade authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users with sub-100ms response times
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with comprehensive error handling
- **Scalability**: Support Engineering Department's growing energy trading needs
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with AMI systems and Solana blockchain

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- API Gateway core implementation (Rust/Axum)
- Authentication & authorization system
- Blockchain integration layer
- Database design and implementation
- AMI system integration
- Trading endpoints and market data
- Analytics and reporting features
