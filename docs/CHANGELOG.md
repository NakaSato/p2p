# Changelog

All notable changes to the P2P Energy Trading Smart Contracts project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section in README
- Error code reference table for common issues
- Debug commands for contract state inspection
- Oracle funding requirements documentation

### Changed
- Updated README with improved oracle client documentation
- Enhanced transaction flow example with oracle funding steps
- Clarified contract deployment order and dependencies

### Fixed
- Oracle client test failures due to insufficient balance
- `request_energy_data_works` test now properly funds oracle before requests
- `unauthorized_fulfill_fails` test fixed with proper oracle funding setup
- `fund_oracle_operations_works` test now uses proper value transfer simulation

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- Initial implementation of four core smart contracts:
  - Registry Contract for identity management
  - GridToken Contract (PSP22-compatible) for energy tokenization
  - Trading Contract for order book and market clearing
  - OracleClient Contract for external data integration

### Features
- **Registry Contract (`contracts/registry`)**
  - User registration and verification
  - Smart meter assignment and management
  - Admin role management
  - Campus location tracking

- **GridToken Contract (`contracts/grid-token`)**
  - PSP22 standard compliance with OpenBrush
  - Energy-backed token minting (1 kWh = 1 GRID)
  - Authorized minting for AMI integration
  - Token burning for energy consumption tracking

- **Trading Contract (`contracts/trading`)**
  - Order book implementation with sell/buy orders
  - Automated market clearing every 15 minutes
  - Price-time priority matching algorithm
  - Cross-contract integration with Registry and GridToken

- **OracleClient Contract (`contracts/oracle-client`)**
  - Chainlink Keepers integration
  - Smart meter data request/fulfill pattern
  - Automated market clearing triggers
  - Multi-oracle operator support

### Architecture
- Cross-contract communication pattern
- Event-driven architecture for external integrations
- Role-based access control across all contracts
- Modular design for independent contract upgrades

### Security
- Multi-signature admin controls
- Oracle operator authorization
- Meter access verification
- Economic security through token staking

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all contracts
- Integration test scenarios
- End-to-end transaction flow validation
- Gas optimization testing

### Documentation
- Complete README with deployment guide
- Transaction flow example documentation
- API reference for all contract methods
- Network deployment checklist

### Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: ink! 4.3.0 smart contracts
- **Standard**: PSP22 token implementation
- **Network**: Substrate-based chains with contracts pallet
- **Language**: Rust with ink! macros
- **Dependencies**: OpenBrush for PSP22 standards

### Performance
- Optimized contract sizes
- Gas-efficient operations
- Batch processing for market clearing
- Event indexing for efficient queries

### Known Limitations
- Oracle client requires manual funding for operations
- Market clearing is epoch-based (15-minute intervals)
- Single-chain deployment (no cross-chain features)
- Limited to campus/institutional deployment scale

### Future Roadmap
- Battery storage token integration
- Carbon credit rewards system
- Cross-campus trading network
- AI-powered demand forecasting
- Government energy market integration

## Development Notes

### Testing Environment
- All tests run with simulated ink! environment
- Oracle funding simulation using `ink::env::test::set_value_transferred`
- Comprehensive error handling validation
- Performance profiling capabilities

### Deployment Requirements
- Rust toolchain with `cargo-contract`
- Substrate node with contracts pallet
- Sufficient native tokens for contract deployment
- Oracle operator keys for automated operations

### Contributing Guidelines
- Follow ink! best practices
- Maintain 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Document all public APIs
- Security review required for contract changes
