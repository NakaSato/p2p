# Docker Image Storage Optimization Results

## Size Comparison

### Before Optimization
| Component | Original Image | Size |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| Solana Validator | `p2p-solana-validator:latest` | **5.0GB** |
| Contract Deployer | `p2p-contract-deployer:latest` | **1.21GB** |
| **Total** | | **6.21GB** |

### After Optimization (Multi-stage builds)
| Component | Optimized Image | Size | Reduction |
|-----------|----------------|------|-----------|
| Solana Validator | `p2p-validator:optimized` | **1.49GB** | **-70.2%** (3.51GB saved) |
| Contract Deployer | `p2p-contract-deployer:optimized` | **1.49GB** | **+23.1%** (0.28GB added) |
| **Total** | | **2.98GB** | **-52.0%** (3.23GB saved) |

## Optimization Techniques Applied

### Multi-stage Build Strategy
1. **Builder Stage**: Contains all build tools (Rust, Node.js, build dependencies)
2. **Runtime Stage**: Minimal Ubuntu base with only runtime dependencies

### Key Improvements
- **Minimal Runtime Dependencies**: Only essential packages in final image
- **Binary-only Copy**: Only compiled binaries copied from builder stage
- **Cache Cleanup**: Removed cargo registry and build artifacts
- **Minimal Base**: Ubuntu 22.04 instead of full development images

### Storage Savings
- **Total Space Saved**: 3.23GB (52% reduction)
- **Validator Optimization**: 3.51GB saved (70% reduction)
- **Combined Images**: From 6.21GB â†’ 2.98GB

## Performance Notes
- ARM64/AMD64 emulation warnings (expected on Apple Silicon)
- Build time increased due to multi-stage compilation
- Runtime performance equivalent or better (smaller attack surface)
- Deployment pipeline compatibility maintained

## Usage
```bash
# Use optimized compose file
docker-compose -f docker-compose.optimized.yml up

# Or with specific services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.optimized.yml up solana-validator contract-deployer
```

## Future Optimizations
- Consider Alpine Linux base (could save additional ~200MB)
- Implement distroless images for even smaller footprint
- Cross-platform builds for native ARM64 support
- Layer caching optimization for faster rebuilds
