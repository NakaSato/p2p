### Database Migration Strategy

```rust
// Migration management
use sqlx::migrate::MigrateDatabase;

pub async fn run_migrations(database_url: &str) -> Result<(), sqlx::Error> {
    if !Postgres::database_exists(database_url).await? {
        Postgres::create_database(database_url).await?;
    }
    
    let pool = PgPool::connect(database_url).await?;
    sqlx::migrate!("./migrations").run(&pool).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Rollback Strategy

#### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 500ms
- Manual trigger

#### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate**: Route traffic to previous version
2. **Database**: Apply reverse migrations if needed
3. **Monitoring**: Verify system health
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders
