```

### Database Migration Strategy

```rust
// Migration management
use sqlx::migrate::MigrateDatabase;

pub async fn run_migrations(database_url: &str) -> Result<(), sqlx::Error> {
    if !Postgres::database_exists(database_url).await? {
        Postgres::create_database(database_url).await?;
    }
    
    let pool = PgPool::connect(database_url).await?;
    sqlx::migrate!("./migrations").run(&pool).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Rollback Strategy

#### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 500ms
- Manual trigger

#### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate**: Route traffic to previous version
2. **Database**: Apply reverse migrations if needed
3. **Monitoring**: Verify system health
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders

- Health monitoring operational (originally Week 2)
- Docker environment exceeds original requirements

**Schedule Benefits:**
- 2-3 weeks buffer created for complex features
- Extra time for authentication system refinement
- Additional testing and optimization opportunities
- Potential for early production deployment

### Next Steps

1. **Week 2**: Authentication system implementation (high priority)
2. **Ongoing**: Daily standups and progress tracking
3. **Weekly**: Review progress against updated milestones
4. **Monthly**: Stakeholder review and plan adjustment

### Success Factors

- Clear communication and stakeholder alignment ✅
- Consistent execution of quality practices ✅
- Proactive risk management ✅
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment 🔄
- Focus on Engineering Department requirements ✅

This updated plan serves as the blueprint for delivering a production-ready API Gateway that will enable the Engineering Department's transition to decentralized energy trading while maintaining the highest standards of security, performance, and reliability. The strong Week 1 foundation positions the project for continued success and potential early delivery.
