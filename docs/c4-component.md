# P2P Energy Trading System - C4 Component Diagrams Overview

This document provides an overview of the API Gateway's internal architecture through multiple focused diagrams. The complex architecture has been separated into logical layers for better understanding and maintainability.

## 📋 Component Architecture Layers

The API Gateway follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers:

### 🎛️ **Controllers Layer**
**[View Controllers Diagram →](c4-component-controllers.md)**

- **Purpose**: Handle HTTP requests, validation, and routing
- **Components**: Authentication, User Management, Trading, Energy Data, and Admin controllers
- **Interactions**: Nginx load balancing, frontend requests, middleware validation

### 🧠 **Services & Business Logic Layer**  
**[View Services Diagram →](c4-component-services.md)**

- **Purpose**: Implement core business logic and orchestration
- **Components**: Blockchain, User, Trading, Energy, Oracle, and Notification services
- **Interactions**: Inter-service communication, blockchain integration, data processing

### 💾 **Data Access & External Integrations**
**[View Data Access Diagram →](c4-component-data.md)**

- **Purpose**: Data persistence, caching, and external system integration
- **Components**: Database repositories, cache management, event streaming, external clients
- **Interactions**: PostgreSQL operations, Redis caching, Kafka streaming, AMI integration

## 🏗️ **Architecture Patterns Implemented**

| Pattern | Layer | Implementation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Clean Architecture** | All Layers | Clear separation between controllers, services, and repositories |
| **Repository Pattern** | Data Layer | Abstraction over data access with SQLx and Redis |
| **Middleware Pattern** | Controllers | Cross-cutting concerns like auth, rate limiting, and auditing |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Services | Kafka-based event streaming for real-time processing |
| **External Integration Pattern** | Data Layer | Dedicated clients for smart meters and REC validation |

## 🔗 **Complete System Architecture**

For the full integrated view showing all components and their relationships, refer to the individual layer diagrams above. Each diagram focuses on specific architectural concerns while maintaining clear boundaries and interfaces between layers.

### **Key Integration Points:**

- **Controllers ↔ Services**: HTTP handlers delegate to business logic services
- **Services ↔ Repositories**: Business logic uses repositories for data access
- **Services ↔ External Systems**: Blockchain and external API integrations
- **Middleware ↔ Cross-cutting**: Authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging

## 🎯 **Benefits of Layered Architecture**

- **🔧 Maintainability**: Each layer can be modified independently
- **📈 Scalability**: Services can be scaled based on specific needs
- **🧪 Testability**: Clear boundaries enable comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **🔒 Security**: Middleware provides consistent security across all endpoints
- **📊 Observability**: Event streaming enables real-time monitoring and analytics

This modular approach ensures the P2P Energy Trading System's API Gateway remains maintainable, scalable, and aligned with clean architecture principles.
